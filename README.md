## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booking-system.git
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**:  
   Navigate to the cloned directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to view the booking system.

3. **Dependencies**:  
   No external libraries are required to run the booking system, as it uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage
- Fill out the booking form with your details, select a date and time, and add any notes.
- Upon clicking "Book Now," a confirmation message will appear, indicating the booking was successful.
- Note: This system currently does not connect to a backend for data storage. For production use, you will need to implement server-side handling to manage bookings effectively.

## Customization
You can customize the booking system to fit your needs by modifying the following:

- **Available Time Slots**: Edit the `<select>` options in the HTML to add or remove time slots.
- **Styling**: Change the CSS in the `<style>` tag to match your branding or design preferences.
- **Backend Integration**: Implement a server-side language (such as PHP, Node.js, or Python) to handle form submissions and store booking details.
